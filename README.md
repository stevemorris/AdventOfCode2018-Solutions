# Advent of Code 2018 Solutions

My solutions in JavaScript to the first 8 1/2 days of challenges from [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018). Note: the website will only show Part 2 of each day's question if you correctly answer Part 1.

## Requirements

Node.js 10.x or later

## Instructions

From the command line, navigate to each folder and run the command:

```console
node code.js
```

The code will process the input data from the input.txt file and output the correct answer(s). Answers have been verified as correct by the Advent of Code website.

Alternatively, you can execute each code.js file from within Visual Studio Code using the extension [Node Exec](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miramac.vscode-exec-node).
